Baklanization and Harbour
==================================

There was a thread on `harbour-users` group:

> Hello Ernad, I was wondering about your work with PostgreSQL; would it be possible run a SQL command and have the result in a mem:table, in memory DBF/VFP version maybe? Or could the result even be in a in memory SQLite table, so we could make additional local queries ?

Answer:

> Hello `harbour-user`, I have wrote about that on harbour-users group, but recently I have realized 
that is forbidden even to to look if you are considering yourself loyal and decent 
harbour developer. Anyway, If your are not 100% guardian of clipper legacy and 
unitarian harbour brand, you are free to read about topic on this ticket:

> The short answer to your question is: YES.

`Harbour-user` replied:

> Thank you, I will probably add an ORM as part of a new "lightweight framework" I will create next year, based on my FastCGI project; will then use your PostgreSQL contribution as one of the SQL backend.
Like you, will make this open source.


My Answer:


> ORM  PostgreSQL embedded into fastcgi framework - Great Idea. I will be watch you on that topic :)
I hope that you have no problem to continue collaboration when I leave harbour community.
It may be that we are not going to use the same tools and call our programming language the same name, 
but nevertheless I am sure we are going to be able understand each other :).

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balkanization 
> In my country, all of us (all ethnicities) speak the same language in the essence (so we understand each other perfectly),
but everyone wants to express differences through language, religion etc.
Because of that, we are FRAGMENTED and we are not willing to collaborate between ourselves.
We have quite difficult heritage because of that - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bosnian_genocide
So there are two interpretations of the situation which have happened here:

> 1. Some intruder have tried to balkanize our great community - expel him! 

> 2. Majority didn't want to understand and embrace minority: If you don't follow our approach, you are enemy!

> The war started. Warriors from both sides have got the same: misery. That is my history lesson: **Balkanization**.

> I am sure there is consensus between us: you are seeing case 1, I am seeing case 2.

> Dear fellows software developers, All the best!
