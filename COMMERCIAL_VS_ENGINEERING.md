COMMERCIAL vs ENGINEERING interests
======================================

Ther were an discussion on `harbour-users` group. One have compared `agile harbour` with `xharbour`.

I have sublimated that comparison like this:


> What xharbour have changed (and later rollback as another participant sad) is done because their
particular **COMMERCIAL** interests - to sell closed source product to their customers.
Every change I have done is motivated by my particular **ENGINEERING** interests
(applying agile development practices).
My changes can be totally wrong, determined by my limited knowledge,
but anyway that is essential difference.

Ernad.
