Engineer's mind
==============================

Harbour's community is breaking heads about what to do with [harbour/core](https://github.com/harbour/core) <-> [vszakats/hb](https://github.com/vszakats/hb) repositories.
For myself, I have never take time to investigate these changes. Because I don't care.
Everything I need from `harbour` as a tool I get from Viktor's work.
I know, I will angry many with this selfish, careless and superficial statement :).
Nevertheless, as an engineer my goal is to provide my application to work.

I am taking this because I have read a lot of discussions about this, but never find engineering `task list`, something like this:

- Example: my `applicationX` (link to source code repository of application) doesn't work in hb3.4 because of this and this. It is working in hb3.2 perfectly
- My `applicationY` shows memory leaks here built with `hb3.4`, everything is ok when I build with `hb3.2`
- My `applicationZ` needs this library `hb3.4` provides, I cannot build that with `hb3.2`
- Forth case
- ...
- Nth case

This is my opinion how engineers should talk. Everything else I consider as no-engineering talks I honestly don't care.

So, I don't use `hb3.2` not because it doesn't work for me (I don't know), but because `hb3.4` and now this project provides
it what I need - my applications to work.
