# agile harbour

## 1. Harbour programming language

### 1.1 Harbour based projects - common scenario 

Harbour programming language is used in production exclusively for business applications (ERP, accounting). Harbour applications have had built at first place with Clipper/DOS (now abandoned programing environment). Projects are built and maintained dominantly by `"old school"` and old age developers :(.  

### 1.2 Harbour Ecosystem (target platforms)

Many harbour developers are relying on commercial GUI and reporting libraries (eg. FiveWin, Xailer).
These library vendors primarily targets `windos/WinAPI` (32-bit) platform. Linux and MacOS are not used in production evironments (fronted).
The exception are those who use client/server DBF base applications (letodb, netio backend). They often target `linux`. 
In the summary, most of harbour applications in production are running in Windows OS environments. 

### 1.3 Current state

Harbour community is (like most IT communities) enthusiastic about programming language.
The truth is crude:
  - There are NO notable NEW projects built with harbour. 
  - The programming language project is in stalled state. Two lead developers recently abandoned project.
  - Already small community is additionaly fragmented by pratices and vision of future

### 1.4 Future directions

Because of all this facts, let's be realistic.
Community have to explore ways to revive project in directions which can be *achived* in short term with small engineering workforce and *applied* to existing projects! 
So, investing into mobile and web technologies is not a good direction. We don't have enough time and engineering resources (either skills or man's power) to make competitive platform for mobile or web. Because of that we should focus on *standard desktop* and *server* systems. Also, our efforts needs to be directed to projects and applications where harbour still have its competitive value.

### 1.5 Harbour's strengths and weaknesses

#### 1.5.1 business application know-how

Harbour community is old. It is problem. The other side of the coin is this: 

**Most of us have GREAT experience in the area of building and maintaing business applications.** 

We build and maintain this kind of applications in **production** for decades. This is HUGE potential unused by harbour project at this moment.

#### 1.5.2 CUI (character user interface) applications

Harbour is great for building data-entry CUI applications. These applications are robust, effective and **superior** in many use cases over GUI applications. Harbour is top-notch tool for building these kind of applications.

#### 1.5.3. built-in xBase Data manipulation

Clipper have raised its popularity with straightforward data manipulation language integrated into language. But there is the *catch*. This concept is good fit for separate data tables, not databases (related tables). Today, SQL system is no-brain solution for structured tata storage. The core concept of SQL server is `client/server`. File servers are not good solution for shared data access. There are remarkable projects (letodb, netio) which provided the access of DBF tables in client/server regime instead file-server. But, that approach is long-term also "blind path". Why?

1. SQL is **standard** for business data. It is expected to provide by other data users and applications (other systems within organization).

2. More important, harbour community has no **resources** to develop robust solutions in this area. If we sum all harbour developer resources, they cannot achieve 1/1.000.000 resources available to prominent SQL projects (PostgreSQL, MySQL, Oracle, MSSQL).

## 3. Solution: Make GOOD bridges

Let us make good connection with other systems and technologies:
- SQL
- java

HINT: This harbour repository contains PostgreSQL libraries used in production since 2011 [here](https://github.com/hernad/F18).

## 4. Goals of this repository

### 4.1 Simple to use

Developer has to have simple workflow:

#### A) from source code

- prerequisite C compiler
- clone harbour repository github
- build compiler
- set binaries PATH 
- start application's development

#### B) from binary code

- prerequisite C compiler
- download binaries from github
- set binaries PATH
- start application's development

### 4.2 Simple to develop

#### 4.2.1 Simple repository structure

     - hbssl 
     - hbwin
     - sddpg
- tests:
  - all sample and testing code here, arranged by libraries
- tools:
  - win32 (gnu make for Windows - win-make.exe, scripts or setting up msvc compiler)

### 4.3 Pragmatic Operating system / compiler support

#### 4.3.1 Primary

- windows (32/64 bit)
   - msvc (Microsoft Visual C/C++)
- linux (64 bit)
   - gcc (GNU Compiler Collection)

#### 4.3.2 Secondary

- MacOS/darwin
   - small interest
   - can be changed if there is *users's* interest
- windows/cygwin
     I suppose this is used by ... nobody, so candidate for removal
- linux (32 bit)
   - also "rear animal"

### 4.3.3 DROP support

Support for these platforms/compilers is removed (or in the process of removal):
* Operating systems:
    - DOS
    - android
    - IOS
    - beos
    - various exotic unixes
* Compilers:
    - mingw
    - borland bcc
    - djgpp
    - watcom
    - rtlink
    - blinker

## 5. Why!?

### Q5.1: Why NOT msys2/mingw on windows?

A: The same answer as [libreoffice developers](https://wiki.documentfoundation.org/Development/BuildingOnWindows), section 
  `"Why MSVC?"`

### Q5.2: Why not android/IOS ?

 A: Nobody sane is going to use harbour for mobile development in *production* :)

### Q5.3: Why not DOS ?

 A: I am sure existing versions of harbour in the wild (3.0, 3.2, 3.4) or even original Clipper compiler do wanderfull job if you still target DOS platform.
