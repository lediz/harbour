Open-minded veteran
============================================================

Thank you `harbour user` for your comment. 
I must say that I have problem to understand your content. 
Two non-native english speakers can be very easily lost in translation :).

As I understand you appreciate the fact that I am using github.com/hernad/harbour to build my business applications. 
(I intentionally don't call this simply "harbour" after complaints about harbour brand)

And yes, you are right, when you put software in business production, your are liable to your customers.
I am by standards of IT industry a veteran (tomorrow round 50 years, inshallah). 
Somebody who have to think about retirement.

But anyway, I am open-minded. That is the reason why I during my carrier have tried and applied in my 
projects dozen of languages and programming environments (Turbo Pascal, Delphi, Clipper, python, C, C++, rust, java, C#, javascript, typescript, PL/PgSQL, SQL, ansible, bash). 
We are running our applications on Linux (server and desktop) and Windows (desktop) environments. 

I am running ultra-small size business (1 programmer + 1 system admin/customer support).
I am building software for 25 years. During that period I have learned a lot, built and deployed a lot, 
failed a lot, and most important: I have gathered a lot of experience. 
And I was open to share my knowledge with this community.
After this discussions, I am not. 
Talking about harbour brand, clipper compatibility, fork or not fork wasn't my intention.
You can continue (I am referring to the community in general) talk, I will continue to commit and build software.

Anyway, as I earlier sad, I will respect wishes of majority. 
And I will protect my business. About that there is no doubt :).

Regards,
Ernad
